## Icebox Items 🧊

- I was hoping to include some of my own drawings into the design! While I ended up sketching some of those out, unfortunately because of time constraints they didn't make it into the current version
- Include animation where coins fall from the screen when a user hits jackpot
- Implement more of the game features that were in the original wireframe (e.g. x and pay table buttons)
- Make game design responsive for mobile users
